/**
 *      A MapReduce is a data processing tool which is used to process the data parallelly in a distributed form.
 *      The MapReduce is a paradigm which has two phases, the mapper phase, and the reducer phase. In the Mapper, the input is given in the form of a key-value pair. The output of the Mapper is fed to the reducer as input. The reducer runs only after the Mapper is over. The reducer too takes input in key-value format, and the output of reducer is the final output.
 *      Steps in Map Reduce:
 *      --> The map takes data in the form of pairs and returns a list of <key, value> pairs. The keys will not be unique in this case.
